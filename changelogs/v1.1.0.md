# Breaking changes

- `mapControllersToActions` has been deleted. You should now import the controller from the `controllers/index.js` which should import the `actionTypes.js` that exports all your action types.
- Your `actions.js` should now export default the `mapActionTypesToActions` which exports all the actions that can be dispatched.
